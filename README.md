# PISA 2012 Data Exploration 

## About PISA

The OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) surveys, which take place every threeyears, have been designed to collect information about 15-year-old students in participating countries. PISA examines how well students are prepared to meet the challenges of the future, rather than how well they master  particular curricula. 

## Research questions and methodology

Mathematics is an intense subject. Apart from crunching numbers in mind or in calculator, there are various other factors like support from parents and teachers, play an important role in scoring good grades. Not just external support, but how interesting a student find subject, is also of utmost importance. In this document, I will explore the cause and relationship among students scoring mathematics to answer the following questions:

- What is the attitude of students towards scoring high scores in math?
- How parents' education level and occupational status play a role in students’ academia?
- How teachers support their students in advance in their academia?

## About dataset
This dataset contains 172491 rows and 636 columns. Out of 636 variables, I shortlisted 17 variables for the purpose of exploration. You can find the detailed explorations in [PISA-exploratory.ipynb](https://github.com/jainsoniya/PISA/blob/master/PISA-%20exploratory.ipynb)


# Summary of findings:

I investigated this dataset with a goal of searching cause and relationship of among students scoring mathematics and have come to the following conclusions: -

1. What is the attitude of students towards scoring high scores in math?
    
    Students having positive attitude (i.e, self- efficacy, interests, motivations, behavior and work ethic) towards math scores better. Students having anxiety issues may feel stressed which in turn have negative impact on the scores.  Males put in more efforts in learning math and have better success compared to females.

2. How parents' education level and occupational status play a role in students’ academia?

    Parents' education level and occupational status have direct impact on students' performance. It is safe to assume that the more educated the parents are, the better attitude would students have towards math’s. 

3. How teachers support their students in advance in their academia?

    Interestingly, teachers' support and their relations with student have negative impact on students’ performance. It is seen that if the students have teachers' support, then they under perform. On the contrary, if the student does not have teacher's support, they put in more efforts and score higher marks.
